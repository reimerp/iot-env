# Configuration for influxdb server to send metrics to
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  # The full HTTP or UDP endpoint URL for your InfluxDB instance.
  # Multiple urls can be specified but it is assumed that they are part of the same
  # cluster, this means that only ONE of the urls will be written to each interval.
  # urls = ["udp://localhost:8089"] # UDP endpoint example
  # This is a DNS name resovable not on container level but on local network
  urls = ["${INFLUXDB_URL}"]
  # The target database for metrics (telegraf will create it if not exists)
  database = "${INFLUXDB_DATABASE}" # required
  # Precision of writes, valid values are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  # note: using second precision greatly helps InfluxDB compression
  #deprecated precision = "s"

  ## Write timeout (for the InfluxDB client), formatted as a string.
  ## If not provided, will default to 5s. 0s means no timeout (not recommended).
  timeout = "5s"
  username = "${INFLUXDB_USER}"
  password = "${INFLUXDB_PASS}"
  # Set the user agent for HTTP POSTs (can be useful for log differentiation)
  user_agent = "telegraf-stats"
  # Set UDP payload size, defaults to InfluxDB UDP Client default (512 bytes)
  # udp_payload = 512
